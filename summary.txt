  For most people, going to college is basically like a trial for adulthood. They are mostly responsible for their lives, but they are still confused about their future and how to get there. Moveover, they are seeking help from their classmates and university mentors. At some point during undergraduate freshmen's academic careers, they need to declare a major, and the time they to this will depend on their universities.
  To provide a balanced and personalized education, there are three kinds of courses: general education courses, major courses, and electives. General education courses are the core classes that all students have to take in order to graduate. It's typical for students to complete them during their first and second years of college. The other type of courses is major courses. These are the classes undergraduates need to complete in order to earn a specific major! The third group of courses is elective courses. They are classes that aren't specifically required by the university, the school, or the department. Electives give them the freedom to explore topics outside their majors so that they can learn more about the world.
  Extracurricular activities in college are clubs, organizations, and activities they can participate in outside the classroom. The main point of these is to help students connect with others and support each other through the experience. And most universities offer many part-time job opportunities for students.
  The last aspect of college life is time management, because it plays a big role in shaping a college student's experience in all areas. And it's important to figure out time management techniques early in the college career.
